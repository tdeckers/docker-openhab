Overview
========

Docker image for Openhab (1.8.3). Included is JRE 1.8.45.


Official DEMO Included
========

If you do not have a openHAB configuration yet, you can start this Docker without one. The official openHAB DEMO will be started.

Pull
=======
```docker pull tdeckers/openhab```

Building
========

```docker build -t <username>/openhab .```

Running
=======

* The image exposes openHAB ports 8080, 8443, 5555 and 9001 (supervisord).
* It expects you to map a configurations directory on the host to `/etc/openhab`. This allows you to inject your openhab configuration into the container (see example below).
  * `/etc/openhab` - openHAB configuration
  * `/opt/openhab/logs` - openHAB logs
  * `/opt/openhab/webapps/static` - Folder for uuid & secret for http://my.openhab.org
  * `/opt/openhab/etc` - Folder for data like db4o and rr4jd
* To enable specific plugins, add a file with name `addons.cfg` in the configuration directory which lists all addons you want to add.

  Example content for `addons.cfg`:
  ```
  org.openhab.action.mail
  org.openhab.action.squeezebox
  org.openhab.action.xmpp
  org.openhab.binding.exec
  org.openhab.binding.http
  org.openhab.binding.knx
  org.openhab.binding.mqtt
  org.openhab.binding.networkhealth
  org.openhab.binding.serial
  org.openhab.binding.squeezebox
  org.openhab.io.squeezeserver
  org.openhab.persistence.cosm
  org.openhab.persistence.db4o
  org.openhab.persistence.gcal
  org.openhab.persistence.rrd4j
  ```

* The openHAB process is managed using supervisord.  You can manage the process (and view logs) by exposing port 9001. From there it is possible to switch between NORMAL and DEBUG versions of OpenHAB runtime.
* The container supports starting without network (`--net="none"`), and adding network interfaces using pipework.
* You can add a timezone file in the configurations directory, which will be placed in `/etc/timezone`. Default: UTC.

  Example content for timezone:
  ```
  Europe/Brussels
  ```

Example: run command (with your openHAB config)
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -v /tmp/configuration:/etc/openhab/ tdeckers/openhab
=======
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -v /tmp/configuration:/etc/openhab tdeckers/openhab
>>>>>>> 325750d... Various
```


Example: Map configuration and logging directory as well as allow access to Supervisor:
```
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 9001:9001 -v /tmp/configurations/:/etc/openhab -v /tmp/logs:/opt/openhab/logs tdeckers/openhab
```

Example: run command (with Demo)
```
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 tdeckers/openhab
```

Start the Demo with:
```
http://[IP-of-Docker-Host]:8080/openhab.app?sitemap=demo
```
Access Supervisor with:
```
http://[IP-of-Docker-Host]:9001
```


HABmin
=======

HABmin is not included in this deployment.  However you can easily add is as follows:
```
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -v /<your_location>/webapps/habmin:/opt/openhab/webapps/habmin -v /<your_location>/openhab/config:/etc/openhab -v /<your_location>/openhab/addons-available/habmin:/opt/openhab/addons-available/habmin tdeckers/openhab
```

Then add these lines to addon.cfg
```
habmin/org.openhab.binding.zwave
habmin/org.openhab.io.habmin
```
